----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open MPI has detected that a parameter given to a command line
option does not match the expected format:

  Option: np
  Param:  4./Helmholtz

This is frequently caused by omitting to provide the parameter
to an option that requires one. Please check the command line and try again.
